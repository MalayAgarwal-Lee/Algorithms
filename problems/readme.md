## Problems from CLRS

This folder contains solutions and discussions of problems in the CLRS books. All implementations are in C. Note that problems also include problems discussed in explaining concepts like dynamic programming and greedy techniques. The problem statements and section where they can be found in the book are mentioned below:

* [Leftmost minimum element in each row of an M X N Monge array - Problem 4-6](leftmost_min_monge_array.c)
* [Optimal parenthesization for computing the product of a chain of matrices - A problem of dynamic programming](matrix_chain_multiplication.c)
