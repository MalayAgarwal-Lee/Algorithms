C implementations of popular algorithms for doing various tasks, ranging from sorting to finding the shortest path or finding a substring in a string.

The list of algorithms implemented is:

* [Binary Search](binary_search/binary_search.c)
* [Strassen's Matrix Multiplication](strassen_mat_mul/strassen_mat_mul.c)
* [Counting Sort](counting_sort/counting_sort.c)
* [Breadth First Search (Using Adjacency List)](breadth_first_search/bfs.c)
* [Depth First Search (Using Adjacency List)](depth_first_search/dfs.c)
* [Topological Sort](topological_sort/topological_sort.c)
